# PR0JECT_ORGINIZATION_AND_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN

## Purpose
Create a concise, actionable, step-by-step guide to organize and optimize all Markdown (`.md`) documents in this repository, following vibe coding best practices for clarity, consistency, and maintainability.

## Scope
- All Markdown files in the repository, notably those under `docs/`, top-level `README.md`, `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `TODO.md`, and any subproject docs.
- Non-Markdown artifacts are out of scope except for cross-linking.

## Principles (Vibe Coding Best Practices)
- Consistency over preference; pick one style and apply everywhere.
- Short, skimmable sections with strong headings and bullets.
- Clear ownership and lifecycle (draft, active, deprecated, archived).
- Minimal duplication; prefer linking over copy-paste.
- Docs reflect the code and process as they are today.

## Target Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview, quickstart, key links.
- `docs/` (single source of truth):
  - `architecture/` — system diagrams, component overviews.
  - `process/` — SDLC, checklists, status, timelines.
  - `guides/` — how-tos, troubleshooting, monitoring.
  - `reference/` — specifications, APIs, schemas.
  - `plans/` — roadmaps, implementation plans, decisions, risk.
  - `security/` — threat models, controls, secrets policy.
  - `status/` — live status pages, dashboards snapshots.
  - `index.md` — categorized table of contents to all docs.

## Naming Conventions
- Kebab-case file names: `topic-name.md`.
- Prefix with date for decisions/notes: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Use `README.md` inside subfolders to provide local overviews.

## Frontmatter Template (optional)
```
---
status: active | draft | deprecated
owner: team/handle
summary: One-line purpose
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

## Content Guidelines
- Start with a 2–3 sentence summary and a TL;DR bullet list.
- Prefer lists and short paragraphs. Avoid walls of text.
- Each doc should state audience and expected outcomes.
- Cross-link related docs with relative links.
- Add diagrams where helpful; store sources under `docs/assets/`.

## Quality Checklist (apply to every doc)
- Title is meaningful and unique
- Clear summary and audience
- Consistent heading levels (### max depth 3)
- Uses bullets and short paragraphs
- Links validated (no broken links)
- No duplication with other docs (or explicitly references canonical source)
- Up-to-date as of `last_reviewed`
- Ownership and status set

## Migration Plan (Phased)
1) Inventory
- Generate an inventory of all `.md` files with paths and sizes.
- Tag each doc with category (architecture, guide, process, reference, plan, security, status) and status (draft/active/deprecated).

2) Restructure
- Create subfolders under `docs/` per Target Structure.
- Move files accordingly; update links using relative paths.
- Add `docs/index.md` with categorized TOC.

3) Normalize
- Rename files to kebab-case; remove ambiguous terms.
- Add frontmatter to each doc; fill metadata.
- Apply heading hierarchy and style cleanup.

4) De-duplicate
- Identify overlapping docs; consolidate into a single canonical doc.
- Replace duplicates with brief stubs pointing to the canonical source.

5) Optimize
- Add TL;DR sections and quick links.
- Convert long checklists into concise, actionable lists.
- Extract long sections into separate focused guides.

6) Govern
- Add `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` section with doc style rules.
- Set up a monthly review cadence; track `last_reviewed`.
- Add CI link check and markdown lint.

## Concrete Actions for This Repo
- Create folders: `docs/{architecture,process,guides,reference,plans,security,status,assets}`.
- Move examples:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/architecture/overview.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE_FINDINGS.md` → `docs/architecture/findings.md`
  - `docs/COMPONENT_MAPPING_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/architecture/component-mapping.md`
  - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/PHASE_4_ROADMAP.md` → `docs/plans/phase-4-roadmap.md`
  - `docs/PHASE_3_SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` → `docs/plans/phase-3-success-criteria.md`
  - `docs/PHASE_3_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/process/phase-3-validation-checklist.md`
  - `docs/COORDINATION_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/process/coordination-checklist.md`
  - `docs/SDLC_TRACKING.md` → `docs/process/sdlc-tracking.md`
  - `docs/INTEGRATION_TIMELINE.md` → `docs/process/integration-timeline.md`
  - `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md` → `docs/guides/infrastructure-setup.md`
  - `docs/RELlABILITY_TROUBLESHOOTING_PLAN.md` → `docs/guides/reliability-troubleshooting.md`
  - `docs/MONITORING_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/monitoring-guide.md`
  - `docs/SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md` → `docs/security/framework.md`
  - `docs/LEGAL_CODE_OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION.md` → `docs/security/legal-ownership-verification.md`
  - `docs/RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` → `docs/plans/risk-assessment.md`
  - `docs/SYSTEM_RELIABILITY_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/status/system-reliability-summary.md`
  - `docs/SUCCESS_METRICS_DASHBOARD.md` → `docs/status/success-metrics-dashboard.md`
  - `docs/STATUS.md` → `docs/status/README.md`
  - `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` → `docs/reference/technical-specification.md`
  - `HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md` → `docs/plans/hybrid-architecture-proposal.md`
- Add `docs/index.md` with categorized links and owners.

## Link Hygiene
- Use relative links (e.g., `../guides/monitoring-guide.md`).
- Avoid bare URLs; use `[label](url)`.
- Prefer linking to files over sections when anchors may change.

## Linting and CI
- Add `markdownlint` config `.markdownlint.json` with rules: heading style, no-trailing-spaces, max line length 100, list indentation.
- Add link-checker step in CI (e.g., `lychee` or `markdown-link-check`).

## Review and PR Template
- Introduce a docs PR checklist:
  - Categories and location follow Target Structure
  - Frontmatter fields are set
  - Links validated
  - Naming kebab-case
  - TOC updated

## Ownership
- Docs DRI: assign team/handle; contributors follow `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Monthly rotation to review status and `last_reviewed`.

## Success Criteria
- Single canonical location per topic.
- Discoverability via `docs/index.md` within 2 clicks.
- No broken links or duplicated content.
- Consistent style across all docs.
